# esphome-desfire-ev3

An ESPHome external component that reads and authenticates **MIFARE DESFire EV3** (and EV1/EV2) NFC cards using a **PN532** reader over I2C — with no dependency on ESPHome's built-in `pn532` component.

---

## Features

- **Non-blocking state machine** — never stalls the ESPHome main loop; WiFi, MQTT, OTA, and other components stay responsive at all times
- **AES-128 mutual authentication** with a DESFire application key
- **Encrypted file read** — decrypts an AES-CBC payload from a card file
- **Self-contained PN532 driver** — implements the PN532 I2C frame protocol directly (no `pn532_i2c:` needed)
- **Automatic retry with I2C bus recovery** — transient RF/I2C failures are retried transparently (up to 2 retries) with hardware bus recovery
- **Fast card detection** — full auth + read completes in ~80–150 ms; card removal detected within ~300 ms
- **Text and binary sensors** — UID, decrypted result, and auth status published to Home Assistant
- Portable **software AES-128** — no external crypto libraries required
- **ESP32 and ESP8266 compatible**

## Hardware

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **ESP32** (recommended) | Any ESPHome-supported board. Dual-core gives best results. |
| **ESP8266** | Works, but keep your YAML config lean (see [ESP8266 Notes](#esp8266-notes)). |
| **PN532 NFC module** | Connected via I2C (default address `0x24`). |

### Wiring

Wire the PN532 to the ESP's I2C bus and set its mode switches to **I2C**.

**Recommended ESP32 pins:**

| Signal | GPIO | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| SDA | **GPIO 21** | Default I2C data line |
| SCL | **GPIO 22** | Default I2C clock line |

> **Pull-ups:** Use **4.7 kΩ external pull-ups** on both SDA and SCL to 3.3 V. Most PN532 breakout boards (Adafruit, Elechouse) already have pull-ups soldered on — if yours does, don't add external ones.

**Pins to avoid:** GPIO 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6–11, 12, 15, 34–39. See the [ESP32 GPIO reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html) for details.

## Installation

### Option 1: Git reference (recommended)

Add to your YAML — ESPHome will clone the component automatically:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/fabian-kapko/esphome-desfire-ev3
      ref: main
```

### Option 2: Local copy

Copy the `components/desfire_reader/` directory into your ESPHome config folder:

```
your-esphome-config/
├── your-device.yaml
└── components/
    └── desfire_reader/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── desfire_reader.h
        └── desfire_reader.cpp
```

## How it works

```
ESP ──I2C──► PN532 ──RF──► DESFire card
```

### Architecture

The component uses a **non-blocking state machine** that runs inside ESPHome's `loop()` (~16 ms cycle time). Each loop iteration performs at most **one** I2C operation, then returns control to the main loop. This ensures WiFi, MQTT, OTA, and all other components remain fully responsive.

`update()` (called at `update_interval`) only sets a flag to trigger a new card detection cycle. The actual protocol steps are driven by `loop()`.

### Protocol flow

1. **Card detection** — sends `InListPassiveTarget` (ISO 14443-A, 106 kbps)
2. **SelectApplication** — selects the configured App ID on the card
3. **AES authentication** — performs the DESFire AES mutual-auth handshake (challenge/response with `RndA` / `RndB`)
4. **ReadData** — reads from file `0x01`
5. **AES-128-CBC decrypt** — decrypts the file payload with `data_key` and a zero IV
6. **Publish** — pushes UID, result string, and auth state to ESPHome sensors

When the card is removed (2 consecutive missed polls), sensors are cleared back to their default state.

### Error recovery

| Failure type | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Timeout** (ACK or response) | Automatic I2C bus recovery → PN532 wakeup → retry (up to 2 retries) |
| **Wrong application** (SelectApp fails) | Immediate fail — card doesn't have the expected app |
| **Wrong key** (auth fails) | Immediate fail — crypto mismatch, not retryable |
| **I2C hardware timeout** | Bus recovery (9 SCL clocks + STOP condition) → re-initialize → retry |
| **Max retries exceeded** | Exponential backoff cooldown (100 ms → 200 ms → 400 ms → … → 5 s max) |

### Timing

| Operation | Typical time |
|---|---|
| Full auth + read (happy path) | ~80–150 ms |
| Card removal detection | ~300 ms |
| Retry after transient failure | ~50 ms |
| Single `loop()` iteration | < 2 ms |

### PN532 I2C framing

The component speaks directly to the PN532 using its native frame format (preamble · start-code · LEN · LCS · TFI · data · DCS · postamble) without relying on ESPHome's built-in PN532 driver. This means:

- No `pn532_i2c:` entry is needed in your YAML
- No conflict if you happen to have other PN532-based components
- The component is fully self-contained

---

## Card preparation

The card must have an application with:

- **App ID** matching `app_id`
- **Key 0** matching `app_key` (AES-128)
- **File 0x01** — containing data encrypted with `data_key` under AES-128-CBC with a zero IV

You can provision cards with [desfire-ev3-pywriter](https://github.com/fabian-kapko/desfire-ev3-pywriter).

## ESP8266 Notes

The component works on ESP8266 but with tighter constraints:

| Resource | ESP8266 available | Component uses | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RAM | ~80 KB | ~1.1 KB | ✅ OK |
| Flash | 1–4 MB | ~15–20 KB compiled | ✅ OK |
| Stack | ~4 KB | ~200 B per `loop()` | ✅ OK |

**Recommendations for ESP8266:**

- Use `update_interval: 500ms` or higher (don't go below 300 ms)
- Keep your YAML lean — avoid loading too many other components
- Monitor free heap; keep it above ~15 KB for stable WiFi:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "Free Heap"
    lambda: 'return ESP.getFreeHeap();'
    update_interval: 10s
    unit_of_measurement: "B"
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `PN532 not responding` at boot | Bad wiring or wrong I2C address | Check SDA/SCL wiring, confirm PN532 mode switches are set to I2C, verify address with `i2c: scan: true` |
| `SelectApp FAILED` | Wrong `app_id` or card doesn't have the app | Verify `app_id` matches the application on the card |
| `AES auth FAILED — wrong app key?` | `app_key` doesn't match key 0 on the card | Re-provision the card with the correct key |
| `Auth1 read timeout` (occasional) | RF signal instability, card at edge of field | Hold card closer to reader; component will auto-retry up to 2 times |
| `I2C hardware timeout detected` | I2C bus locked up after a failed transaction | Component auto-recovers the bus; if persistent, check wiring and pull-ups |
| Frequent API disconnects | I2C operations blocking too long | Should not happen with current version; check for other blocking components |
